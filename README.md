# sat-solver
This repository contains the assignments and final project of ECE650 (Methods and Tools for Software Engineering).

The project involved implementing a tokenizer and parser in C++, generating ASTs for input Boolean formulas, and incorporating error handling mechanisms. Tseitinâ€™s Transformation was applied to transform Boolean formulas into an equisatisfiable formula in CNF. In addition, the project constructed a SAT solver based on the DPLL algorithm, utilizing Unit Propagation and Pure Literal Elimination for efficient Boolean satisfiability problem resolution.
